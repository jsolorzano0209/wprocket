I have several variations that I managed to test from a demo site where I replicated the notice errors. 

-The first one has a basic function(remove_a to remove all admin notices. 

-Second option would be to use CSS to remove only notice error class messages.

-Lastly, although I was unable to get it working, it should be possible to remove action for admin notice message from notice.php(wp-rocket/inc/admin/ui/notices.php).
