I have several variations that I managed to test from a demo site where I replicated the notice errors. The first one has a basic function(remove_a to remove all admin notices. Other alternative would be to remove action for admin notice message from notice.php(wp-rocket/inc/admin/ui/notices.php). Lastly, another option is using CSS to remove only notice error class messages.
